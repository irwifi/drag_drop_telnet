Think - Telia Project for sales

Things to do: 
- slider
- create parrent and children - when name is typed into the input field and parrent/child is clicked, the person will be added by with a icon, with the name beneath it.
- services menu with colors on the right can be pressed and every point has 3 extra points when pressed
- every service has a price and can be dragged to the parrent/child in the circle in the center of the screen.
- when services is added/removed, the amount counter in the bottom will increase and decrease

Questions for the next meeting:

creating users:
what happents when multiple users is added ? and what is the limit/max -> are we able to change the circle to a table maybe ?

are there limits for how many services can be added to a parrent/child ?

"Nuværende løsning" is the current service the customer has and løsning 1 is what the sales person wants to offer the customer ? did i understand this right ?

what is the icons for exactly and when are they used when interacting with the program plane/house/campingvogn/car ?

I understand the app should work on ipad, but the new or old one and landscape or portrait?

Services menu -> does it have to be drag and drop ? we can approace it in a different way, maybe add the service to the user by selecting user first and then pick the services. 

There is a price in the bottom corner, is that for the new price or the old price ?

i would need the prices for every service.

in the buttom right there is a plus -> is that for adding a new Løsning ?

what is the settings button fore exactly ?
