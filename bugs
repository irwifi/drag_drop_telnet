Rightsidemenu
somehow the text is not beeing centeret at start of the apperence of all the iconmenus

Leftsidemenu
Leftside menu is showing up from the start -> should be hidden

"Andet" works fine in drag and drop, but if you change its place, it would show the pop up again and break by giving the same name to the next icon

You are able to kopi a solution when clicked the first time, even though there is nothing to copy from. That would make the program crash by giving the next tab "undefined"

you have to be on solution 1 to be able to kopi a new solution, else it would crash with "undefined" in tab slide

TV -> Solution 1+2 is missing som icons

tv bedbÃ¥nd -> Solution 1+2 is missing some ikons

Services-> Solution 1+2 is missing some ikons
